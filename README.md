## Storage & State Tries

The two "secured" tries in the Ethereum database architecture. That is, for every key / value pair inputted into the database, the key is hashed before putting. State trie and storage trie are the fundamental storage abstraction on which the Ethereum world computer is based. To navigate the state trie you use an `account address` as a key. The value stored at that key value pair are the rlp encoded versions of **nonce**, **balance**, **storageRoot** and **codeHash**. **StorageRoot** and **codeHash** are only relevant to contract accounts. Once a storageRoot is located using the account address, different **contract storage slots** can be accessed to inspect mutable data associated with said contract. When making the rpc request `eth_getStorageAt` you provide amongst other possible parameters the account address and the storage slot key. To action the request the serving node must first search the state trie to locate the account storage root and then use said storage root to locate the storage slot on the particular storage trie.

Contract State Variables are applied to the Storage Trie using the rules of [Layout of State Variables](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/internals/layout_in_storage.html)
