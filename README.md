## Radix Tries

A **Trie** is an ordered data structure. The name _Trie_ is derived from the word re"trie"ve and as the word suggests is a programming structure that is used to locate data. Tries are key / value storage structures in which the keys are organised recursively in a "parent / child" architecture. While it requires a larger file size to store it is very efficient at data retrieval and is much faster than a linear search through data.

A **Radix Trie** is a more memory efficient version of a Trie while a **Patricia Trie** offers even more memory efficiency.
