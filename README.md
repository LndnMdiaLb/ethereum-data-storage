## Reciepts Trie

The Receipts Trie stores data associated to a successful transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. Most interestingly it includes log data. Log data is data about a transaction that although secured by the blockchain is not accessible via a smart contract. It can be gas efficient to store data in a receipt log instead of in account storage.
